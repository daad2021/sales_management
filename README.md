# Introduction
This is a simple  python sales management app which consists of invoice generation, salse records, customer and stock management for practice purpose using tkinter for the GUI and Sqlite for DB.
This can be helpful to any learner. From this simple project, one can learn how to work with several GUI widgets such as Notebook, Frame, Tree view, Combobox, Radio button, Checkbox, Button, Text Entry and Spinbox. You can copy the source code and play arround it, either to improve it or learn from it.
The project is still under development and I will udate the source code whenever I add something new. The next main thing to do is to refactor the code, modularize it and "DRY" it further. Note: It's not perfect for production; only for learning purpose. As you play with it, whenever you want to select an item from any of the tree view widgets, you can either select it and click the select button or simply double click on the item.
Just have fun with it. Cheers!!
