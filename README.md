# sales_management
This is a simple  python sales management app which consists of invoice generation, salse records, customer and stock management for practice purpose using tkinter for the GUI and Sqlite for DB.
This can be helpful to any learner. From this simple project, one can learn how to work with several GUI widgets such as Tree view, Combobox, Radio button, Checkbox, Button, Text Entry and Spinbox. Also, one can learn how to work with the backend from the simple DB added to this project. You can copy the source code and play arround it, either to improve it or learn from it. Just have fun with it. Cheers!!
The project is still under development and I will udate it the source code whenever I add something new. The next main thing to do is to re-factor and modularize the code.
